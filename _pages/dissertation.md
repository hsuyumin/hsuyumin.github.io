## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which examines the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers and its aftermath. The core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in _Comparative Politics_.

In my dissertation, I develop a new theory of labor regulation expansion based on the fundamental challenge of authoritarian rule: autocrats must simultaneously manage the competing interests of both elites and the masses to maintain power. While autocrats may choose to enact pro-worker legislation to pacify mass unrest, such actions often provoke elite challenges. I argue that a limited independent judiciary enables autocrats to recalibrate the distributional outcomes of progressive labor laws in a more flexible manner that ensures their political survival. I illustrate the utility of this argument by employing qualitative evidence from China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL).

In the subsequent chapters of my dissertation, I employ a variety of quantitative data and causal methodology to substantiate the central components of my argument. I present three pieces of evidence. First, I provide causal evidence for the distributional consequences of judicial independence through a difference-in-differences analysis of court rulings data on labor disputes. Second, I explore the long-term stability implications of the compromised judicial enforcement of the LCL on regime support through a pre-registered survey experiment. Third, I probe the generalizability of the argument by utilizing cross-country evidence and constructing a novel latent measure of mass threats.

My dissertation makes two main scholarly contributions. First, my work deepens our understanding of authoritarian institutions and survival strategies. It sheds light on an oft-overlooked function of autocratic courts in facilitating authoritarian governance: they help balance the interests of elites and the masses amid distributive tensions. Second, my dissertation extends the literature on institutions and redistribution. I bring attention to judicial institutions, which, through their decisions and interpretations of the law, determine winners and losers and can thus have significant distributional consequences. Building on this point, my work further points out the inherent flexibility of autocratic judiciaries in influencing these distributional consequences, which autocrats can exploit to advance their own interests.
