## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which aims to shed light on the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers. My core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in _Comparative Politics_.

In my dissertation, I argue that autocrats face a dilemma in pro-worker reforms. While autocrats may choose to make policy concessions to pacify mass unrest, such actions often provoke elite resistance. I develop a theory of judicial balancing that highlights how limited independent judiciaries provide autocrats with the flexibility to either (1) mitigate elites’ losses resulting from pro-worker legislation or (2) tilt the balance in favor of labor, particularly when social stability concerns loom large. I argue that such judicial flexibility helps autocrats better manage the dual challenges in redistributive policy disputes and illustrate the utility of this argument by employing qualitative evidence from China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL).

My dissertation's subsequent chapters employ a variety of quantitative data and causal methodology to support the key aspects of the argument. I analyze comprehensive court rulings data on labor disputes and link them to subnational variations in judicial independence caused by judicial centralization reforms in China. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I provide causal evidence for the argument that increased court independence hampers autocrats' ability to protect elites' interests from worker-friendly legislation. Additionally, I investigate the potential long-term effects of compromised enforcement of the LCL on regime support through a pre-registered survey experiment. The findings suggest that, despite unfulfilled expectations, partial benefits from labor legislation can mitigate backlash. Finally, I explore the argument's generalizability by utilizing cross-country evidence and a new Bayesian latent measure of mass threats.

Combined, these sources allow me to illustrate the true dynamics of pro-worker legislation, from the conditions and processes leading to its enactment to the mass politics it arises.
