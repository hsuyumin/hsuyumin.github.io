## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which aims to shed light on the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers. My core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in _Comparative Politics_.

It is well recognized that authoritarian governments often adopt pro-worker policies as a means to preempt revolutionary threats. However, in many authoritarian regimes, the political and economic elites wield substantial de facto power, which poses an imminent threat to the ruling regime. The enactment of worker-friendly legislation introduces a delicate balancing act for autocrats, who must navigate the inherent tradeoff between providing benefits to workers and mitigating the potential negative impact on the economic interests of the elites.

In my dissertation, I develop a theory of judicial balancing to illustrate the distributional dilemma faced by autocrats and ascertain the conditions under which autocrats enact pro-worker legislation. With a particular focus on the role of autocratic courts, I argue that when a judiciary is limited in its independence, autocrats possess greater flexibility to manipulate the distributional outcomes of progressive labor laws to suit their situational needs. This judicial flexibility provides autocrats with a greater incentive to enact pro-worker legislation in response to bottom-up demand.

My dissertation illustrates the utility of argument using the significant case of China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL), which stands as a prominent example of highly protective labor legislation by international standards. Through within-case process tracing, I spotlight two distinct balancing strategies of autocratic courts prevailing in the post-LCL period. My case analysis reveals that the courts either act as instruments of the regime, prioritizing the interests of elites—especially during economic hardships, or exhibit a strong bias in favor of workers— particularly in circumstances where social instability looms large. This case study highlights how dictatorial governments utilize their ex post control over a limited independent judiciary to survive distributive tensions.

In addition, I assemble, to date, the most comprehensive court rulings data on labor disputes (approximately 500,000 cases) within China. This dataset is then geo-referenced to city-level variations in judicial independence, resulting from the staggered judicial centralization reforms starting in 2015. Utilizing a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that when court independence increases, there is a corresponding increase in pro-worker court decisions. This finding supports my core argument’s theoretical premise, which posits that when courts possess greater independence, authoritarian politicians are less capable of utilizing the judiciary to compensate economic elites for their losses from progressive labor laws.

Furthermore, I probe the long-term stability implications of the judicial balancing strategy. I explore whether the LCL, given its compromised enforcement within the judiciary, has the potential to undermine regime stability in the long run. Through an original, pre-registered survey experiment, I reveal that such legislation does not have a significant negative impact on regime support. Further analysis suggests that such legislation, as long as it still provides partial benefits, can mitigate the backlash resulting from unfulfilled expectations, leading to more mixed and ambivalent attitudes towards the regime among the public. 

Finally, I zoom out from China, utilizing quantitative cross-country evidence to probe the generalizability of my core argument. I advance a novel cross-national measure of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018. I apply a dynamic Bayesian latent variable model that synthesizes 13 observed indicators from two core facets of mass threats, grievance and organizational capacity. Using this new measure, I conduct a time-series cross-sectional data analysis and find robust evidence that supports my argument.

My dissertation makes two main scholarly contributions. First, while past research on autocratic courts has predominantly emphasized their functions in terms of regime legitimation, administrative oversight, commitment-making, and repression, my work sheds light on an oft-overlooked function of autocratic courts: they help balance the interests of elites and the masses amid distributive tensions. Second, while our current understanding of institutions and redistribution revolves primarily around political and electoral institutions, my dissertation expands the scope by examining the role of judicial institutions. I argue that judicial institutions, like any other institutions, play a crucial role in shaping distributional outcomes. Through my theoretical framework and empirical findings, I underscore the inherent flexibility of autocratic judiciaries in influencing these distributional consequences. This insight enhances our understanding of the broader institutional dynamics at play in processes of redistribution and governance within autocratic regimes.
