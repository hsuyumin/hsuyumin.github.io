## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which examines the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers and its aftermath. The core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in Comparative Politics.

In my dissertation, I develop a new theory of labor regulation expansion based on the fundamental challenge of authoritarian rule: autocrats must simultaneously manage the competing interests of both elites and the masses to maintain power. While autocrats may choose to enact pro-worker legislation to pacify mass unrest, such actions often provoke elite challenges. I argue that a limited independent judiciary enables autocrats to recalibrate the distributional outcomes of progressive labor laws in a more flexible manner that ensures their political survival. I illustrate the utility of this argument by employing qualitative evidence from China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL).

My dissertation's subsequent chapters employ a variety of quantitative data and causal methodology to support the key aspects of the argument. I present three pieces of evidence. First, I provide causal evidence for the distributional consequences of judicial independence through a difference-in-differences analysis of court rulings data on labor disputes. Second, I explore the long-term stability implications of the compromised judicial enforcement of the LCL on regime support through a pre-registered survey experiment. Third, I probe the generalizability of the argument by utilizing cross-country evidence with a novel latent measure of mass threats.

Combined, these sources allow me to illustrate the true dynamics of pro-worker legislation, from the conditions and processes leading to its enactment to the mass politics it arises.
