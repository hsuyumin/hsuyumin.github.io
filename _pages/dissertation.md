## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which aims to shed light on the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers. My core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in _Comparative Politics_.

In my dissertation, I develop a new theory of labor regulation expansion based on the fundamental challenge of authoritarian rule: autocrats must simultaneously manage the competing interests of both elites and the masses to maintain power. While autocrats may choose to enact pro-worker legislation to pacify mass unrest, such actions often provoke elite challenges. I argue that a limited independent judiciary enables autocrats to recalibrate the distributional outcomes of progressive labor laws in a more flexible manner that ensures their political survival. I illustrate the utility of this argument by employing qualitative evidence from China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL).

My dissertation's subsequent chapters employ a variety of quantitative data and causal methodology to support the key aspects of the argument. I collect and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis on court rulings data on labor disputes. Through this analysis, I provide causal evidence for a core implication of my argument: that increased court independence limits the ability of autocrats to protect elite interests from worker-friendly legislation through legal channels. I investigate the effect of compromised enforcement of the LCL on regime support through a pre-registered survey experiment. Finally, I examine the argument's generalizability by utilizing cross-country evidence with a novel latent measure of mass threats.

Combined, these sources allow me to illustrate the true dynamics of pro-worker legislation, from the conditions and processes leading to its enactment to the mass politics it arises.
