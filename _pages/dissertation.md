## The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms

I am currently working on my dissertation, which aims to shed light on the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers. My core argument, along with some of the empirical findings, is summarized in my forthcoming paper titled "Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Legislation," scheduled to be published in _Comparative Politics_.

In my dissertation, I argue that autocrats face a dilemma in pro-worker reforms. While autocrats may choose to make policy concessions to pacify mass unrest, such actions often provoke elite resistance. I develop a theory of judicial balancing that highlights how limited independent judiciaries provide autocrats with the flexibility to either (1) mitigate elites’ losses resulting from pro-worker legislation or (2) tilt the balance in favor of labor, particularly when social stability concerns loom large. I argue that such judicial flexibility helps autocrats better manage the dual challenges in redistributive policy disputes and illustrate the utility of this argument by employing qualitative evidence from China’s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL).

The subsequent chapters of my dissertation employ a wide range of quantitative data and causal methodology to substantiate the key aspects of the argument. I assemble, to date, the most comprehensive court rulings data on labor disputes and geo-reference them to subnational variation in levels of judicial independence caused by staggered judicial centralization reforms within China. Utilizing a difference-in-differences analysis, I provide causal evidence for the core argument’s theoretical premise, which posits that increased court independence hinders autocrats’ ability to protect elites’ interests from worker-friendly legislation. Moreover, I explore whether the LCL, given its compromised enforcement within the judiciary, has the potential to undermine regime support in the long run. Through an original, pre-registered survey experiment, I find that such legislation, provided it still delivers partial benefits, can mitigate the backlash resulting from unfulfilled expectations. Finally, I probe the generalizability of the argument utilizing quantitative cross-country evidence paired with a novel Bayesian latent measure of mass threats. Combined, these sources allow me to illustrate the true dynamics of pro-worker legislation, from the conditions and processes leading to its enactment to the mass politics it arises.
