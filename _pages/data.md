## A Latent Measure of Mass Threats in Nondemocracies (1960-2018)


Mass threat is a core explanatory concept in comparative politics. Prior research has emphasized the critical role played by mass threats in driving political dynamics associated with authoritarianism, regime change, and redistributive politics. However, existing measures available in the literature come with their own limitations and do not fully capture the multifaceted nature of this concept.

For example, scholars of democratization often employ grievance-based indicators (e.g., inequality) to gauge the degree of mass threats. However, there has been a longstanding critique that grievances tend to remain relatively stable over time, which limits their explanatory power for time-varying political phenomena. On the other hand, researchers influenced by labor and welfare state research may opt to use variables related to organizational capacity. Still, relying solely on these variables may not suffice to represent mass threats adequately, as it overlooks the underlying motivations that drive the use of such capacity for resistance. A third approach is to look at the frequency of contentious events. Yet, since common event-based measures (e.g., strikes and revolutions) presumably only document realized threats, this approach may omit a large universe of unrealized threats that are also politically consequential.

To overcome these shortcomings, I advance a unified and theoretically informed approach to measuring mass threats in autocracies. I collect data on 13 empirical indicators that encompass two fundamental facets of mass threats: grievance and organizational capacity. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, I incorporate information on these indicators to generate time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018.

The proposed measurement approach has three advantages. First, the latent measure aligns closely with the ontological nature of mass threats as an unobserved quantity. Second, it bridges the existing divide in the use of mass threats in the literature, providing a framework that unifies both grievance and organizational capacity. Third, this measure not only exhibits a strong correlation with event-based measures but also possesses the ability to capture the essential substance of unrealized threats, setting it apart from those frequency measures.
