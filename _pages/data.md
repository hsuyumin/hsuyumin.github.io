I have developed and maintained new cross-country data on a latent measure of mass threats in nondemocracies. No one would deny the centrality of mass threats in comparative politics. Previous research has extensively relied on this concept to elucidate significant political outcomes in authoritarianism, regime change, and the politics of redistribution. While there are numerous existing measures of mass threats in the literature, they come with their own limitations and do not fully capture the complexity of this concept.

For example, scholars of democratization often rely on grievance-based indicators to gauge the degree of mass threats. However, this approach has faced criticism as many argue that grievances are relatively stable over time, making them inadequate for explaining the rise and fall of many political phenomena. On the other hand, researchers influenced by labor and welfare research may opt to use indicators related to organizational capacity as proxies for mass threats. Nevertheless, it remains theoretically unclear as to why, without considering the underlying factors that motivate people to mobilize, such indicators alone can be considered a superior alternative. One can get around this divide by turning to the frequency of contentious events. However, presumably event-based measures only document realized threats, omitting a large universe of unrealized threats that are also politically consequential.

In my dissertation, I advance a unified and theoretically informed measure of mass threats in autocracies. With a specific focus on two fundamental facets of mass threats, i.e., grievances and organizational capacity, I collect 13 observed indicators that have been thoughtfully selected to effectively capture the two facets. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, the model synthesizes information on manifest indicators from the two facets, generating time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018.

The proposed measurement approach offers three advantages. First, the latent measure aligns closely with the ontological nature of mass threats as an unobserved quantity. Second, it bridges the existing divide in the use of mass threats in the literature, providing a framework that unifies both grievance and organizational capacity. Third, this measure not only exhibits a strong correlation with event-based measures but also possesses the ability to capture the essential substance of unrealized threats, setting it apart from those measures.
