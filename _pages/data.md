In my dissertation, I construct a novel latent measure of mass threats in nondemocracies. Mass threat is a core explanatory concept in comparative politics. Prior research has emphasized the critical role played by mass threats in driving political dynamics associated with authoritarianism, regime change, and redistributive politics. While existing measures of mass threats abound, they are constrained by certain limitations and fail to fully capture the multifaceted nature of this concept.

For example, scholars of democratization often rely on grievance-based indicators (e.g., inequality) to gauge the degree of mass threats. However, this approach has been criticized due to the argument that grievances are relatively stable over time, limiting their ability to explain the rise and fall of many political phenomena. On the other hand, researchers influenced by labor and welfare state research may opt to use variables related to organizational capacity. Still, it requires a theoretical justification for why such variables alone suffice to adequately represent mass threats, without considering the underlying incentives that motivate the use of such capacity for resistance. While one can sidestep this unresolved divide by turning to the frequency of contentious events, common event-based measures presumably only capture realized threats, omitting a large universe of unrealized threats that are also politically consequential.

To overcome these shortcomings, I advance a unified and theoretically informed approach to measuring mass threats in autocracies. I collect data on 13 empirical indicators that encompass two fundamental facets of mass threats: grievance and organizational capacity. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, the measurement model synthesizes information on the selected indicators, generating time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018.

The proposed measurement approach has three advantages. First, the latent measure aligns closely with the ontological nature of mass threats as an unobserved quantity. Second, it bridges the existing divide in the use of mass threats in the literature, providing a framework that unifies both grievance and organizational capacity. Third, this measure not only exhibits a strong correlation with event-based measures but also possesses the ability to capture the essential substance of unrealized threats, setting it apart from those frequency measures.
