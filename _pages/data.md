# Data

I have developed and maintained new cross-country data on a latent measure of mass threats in nondemocracies. No one would deny the centrality of mass threats in comparative politics. Previous research has extensively relied on this concept to elucidate significant political outcomes in authoritarianism, regime change, and the politics of redistribution. However, as a student in these fields, I often find it challenging to locate an appropriate measure of this concept for my research. While there are numerous existing measures of mass threats in the literature, they come with their own limitations and do not fully capture the complexity of this concept.

For example, scholars of democratization often use grievance-based indicators to gauge the degree of mass threats. However, many cast doubt on this approach because temporarily invariable factors, which include grievances, are ill-suited to explain the rise and fall of many political phenomena. Conversely, researchers influenced by labor and welfare research may opt to use capacity-based indicators as proxies for mass threats. Nevertheless, it remains theoretically unclear as to why such indicators alone can be considered a superior alternative, without taking into account the underlying factors that drive peopleâ€™s incentives to mobilize. To move beyond this longstanding debate on incentives and capacity, some researchers have opted to use the frequency of contentious events as a measure. However, event-based measures only document realized threats, omitting a large universe of unrealized threats that are also politically consequential.

In my dissertation, I advance a unified and theoretically informed measure of mass threats in autocracies. I focus on the two core facets of mass threats, grievance and organizational capacity, and meticulously gather data from a diverse range of sources, encompassing 13 carefully selected indicators that effectively capture these dimensions. By employing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable model, I have generated time-series cross-sectional data covering 122 authoritarian regimes from 1960 to 2018.

The proposed measurement approach offers three advantages. First, the latent measure aligns closely with the ontological nature of mass threats as an unobserved quantity. Second, it bridges the existing divide in the use of mass threats in the literature, providing a framework that unifies both grievance and organizational capacity. Third, this measure not only exhibits a strong correlation with event-based measures but also possesses the unique ability to capture the essential substance of unrealized threats, setting it apart from those measures.
