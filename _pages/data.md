* A Latent Variable Approach to Measuring Mass Threats in Nondemocracies

    <details>
      <summary>Show Abstract</summary>

      Mass threat is a critical factor in explaining regime change and various political outcomes of authoritarian politics. However, the literature to date is divided over how to measure it in cross-national research. To measure mass threats, while some prior studies rely on measures related to economic grievances, others emphasize the aspect of organizational capacity of mass mobilization. Moreover, substantial data missingness remains a common problem of the existing measures of mass threats. In this paper, I propose a more comprehensive, latent measure of mass threats in non-democracies that seeks to bridge the divide. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, the model synthesizes information on manifest indicators from the two facets, generating time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018. I conduct several checks to demonstrate the validity of the new measure and use it to replicate Svolik’s (2013) central results of the inverted U-shaped relationship between mass threats and military intervention.

Mass threat is a core explanatory concept in comparative politics. Prior research has emphasized the critical role played by mass threats in driving political dynamics associated with authoritarianism, regime change, and redistributive politics. However, despite the availability of various existing measures in the literature, they are constrained by certain limitations and fail to fully capture the multifaceted nature of this concept.

For example, scholars of democratization often rely on grievance-based indicators (e.g., inequality) to gauge the degree of mass threats. However, this approach has been criticized due to the argument that grievances are relatively stable over time, limiting their ability to explain the rise and fall of many political phenomena. On the other hand, researchers influenced by labor and welfare state research may opt to use variables related to organizational capacity. Still, it requires a theoretical justification for why such variables alone suffice to adequately represent mass threats, without considering the underlying incentives that motivate the use of such capacity for resistance. While one can sidestep this unresolved divide by turning to the frequency of contentious events, common event-based measures presumably only capture realized threats, omitting a large universe of unrealized threats that are also politically consequential.

To overcome these shortcomings, I advance a unified and theoretically informed approach to measuring mass threats in autocracies. I collect data on 13 empirical indicators that encompass two fundamental facets of mass threats: grievance and organizational capacity. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, I incorporate information on these indicators to generate time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 122 authoritarian countries from 1960 to 2018.

The proposed measurement approach has three advantages. First, the latent measure aligns closely with the ontological nature of mass threats as an unobserved quantity. Second, it bridges the existing divide in the use of mass threats in the literature, providing a framework that unifies both grievance and organizational capacity. Third, this measure not only exhibits a strong correlation with event-based measures but also possesses the ability to capture the essential substance of unrealized threats, setting it apart from those frequency measures.
