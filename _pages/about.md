I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study the causes and consequences of redistribution both in autocratic and democratic contexts. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

My research on autocratic redistribution elucidates how institutions, e.g., judiciaries, legislatures, and political parties, help solve distributional dilemmas, providing incentives for autocrats to embrace progressive redistribution. My research also advances the research frontier by linking autocratic redistribution and propaganda. I assess the effects of redistributive messaging on political attitudes and theorize why autocrats increasingly employ symbolic tactics in their redistribution strategies. My work on democratic redistribution, on the other hand, sheds light on how centralized institutions constrain elite influence on the implementation of (re)distribution policies, and examines the extent to which misperceptions about policy impact lead the mass public to support regressive taxation that contracts their own interests. 

Broadly speaking, my research draws on insights and contributes to political economy, political institutions, and mass political behavior. I examine a variety of political outcomes in these three subfields. At the macro-level, my work explains variations in the enactment of pro-worker legislation, pro-worker court decisions, public goods provision, and transition to democracy. At the micro level, I analyze regime legitimacy, understandings of democracy, and redistribution preferences. In pursuit of these research themes, I delve into cases from China, Taiwan, and the U.S. via process tracing, quasi-experimental designs, and survey experiments. I also improve on the cross-country measurement of mass threats in non-democracies. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
