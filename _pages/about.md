I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, political institutions, and mass political behavior, with a regional focus on East Asia. 

I study the causes and consequences of redistribution both in autocratic and democratic contexts. My research advances the research frontier of autocratic redistribution by exploring its intersection with autocratic courts and government propaganda. Specifically, I shed light on (1) how dependent courts, through their flexibility to adjudicate cases in accordance with autocrats' situational needs, shape the causes and consequences of autocratic redistribution and (2) why autocrats proactively communicate their redistributive efforts and examine how such propaganda shapes political attitudes. 

My work on democratic (re)distribution, on the other hand, addresses (1) why public goods provision varies across subnational electoral democracies and (2) why individuals support redistribution policies that act against their self-interest. Drawing on evidence from Taiwan and the U.S., I engaged in the debate of decentralization and elite capture and the literature on misperceptions, information, and redistribution preferences. 

My scholarly work has been accepted by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
