I am a PhD student in the Political Science Department at Emory University. My main research agenda centers around redistributive politics under dictatorships, with a focus on labor regulations. My broad research interests include the political economy of inequality and redistribution in developed and developing contexts and politics of public goods provision. 

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from National Taiwan University. I was an exchange student at the Tsinghua University.
