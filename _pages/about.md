I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study autocratic politics, comparative courts, and the political economy of redistribution, with a regional focus on East Asia. 

My main research agenda contributes to redistributive politics under dictatorship by focusing on (1) how autocratic courts help control elite-mass conflicts amid distributive tensions and (2) how authoritarian citizens react to redistributive efforts and the role of propaganda in this process. My dissertation and related research in democratic contexts draw on evidence from China, Taiwan, and the U.S. and utilize a variety of advanced statistical methods to ensure causality and measurement validity. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_ and _Comparative Political Studies_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Atlanta, I lived in Taipei. I received my M.A. and B.A. degree in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I found my intellectual home in autocratic politics and the political economy of redistribution when I visited [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as an exchange student.
