I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, institutions, and behavior, with a substantive focus on redistribution, courts, and propaganda in authoritarian regimes. Geographically, my work concentrates on China, Taiwan, and the United States.

My research revolves around this central question: how do autocrats survive in power when threats from elites and the masses escalate and collide?  I answer this question by focusing on progressive redistribution (e.g., pro-worker legislation), which engenders substantial distributional consequences that bring capital into conflict with labor. My work delves into the strategies employed by autocrats to resolve the distributional dilemma, with an emphasis on courts and propaganda as the autocrat's solutions. Through cross-country and fine-grained evidence from China, I demonstrate the applicability of my theories to the broader strategic dynamics of autocratic redistribution, from the conditions leading to its adoption to the political consequences it engenders.

In a related, secondary agenda, I have conducted and developed policy-relevant research projects on the domestic politics of Taiwan, a case of growing significance with profound implications for regional security amid the rise of China. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
