I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study autocratic politics, comparative courts, and the political economy of redistribution, with a regional focus on East Asia. 

My primary research interest lies in redistributive politics under dictatorship. I contribute to this field by exploring its intersection with autocratic courts and the study of propaganda. Specifically, I study (1) how autocratic courts help manage elite-mass conflicts amid distributive tensions and (2) how authoritarian citizens react to redistributive efforts and the role of propaganda in this process. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_ and _Comparative Political Studies_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Atlanta, I lived in Taipei. I received my M.A. and B.A. degree in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I found my intellectual home in autocratic politics and the political economy of redistribution when I visited [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as an exchange student.
