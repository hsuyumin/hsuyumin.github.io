I am a third-year PhD student in Department of Political Science at Emory University. My main research agenda centers around redistributive politics under dictatorships, with a focus on labor regulations. My broader research interests encompass the political economy of inequality and redistribution in developed and developing contexts and politics of public goods provision. My dissertation committee includes Jennifer Gandhi (Chair), Natalia Bueno, Miguel Rueda, and Jeffrey Staton.

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from National Taiwan University. I was an exchange student at the Tsinghua University in China.
