I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study autocratic politics, comparative courts, and the political economy of redistribution, with a regional focus on East Asia. My main research agenda contributes to redistributive politics under dictatorship by focusing on (1) how autocratic courts help control elite-mass conflicts amid distributive tensions and (2) how authoritarian citizens react to redistributive efforts and the role of propaganda in this process. My dissertation and related research in democratic contexts draw on evidence from China, Taiwan, and the U.S. and utilize a variety of advanced statistical methods to ensure causality and measurement validity. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_ and _Comparative Political Studies_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

My dissertation, _The Autocrat’s Labor Dilemma: How Dependent Courts Manage Elite-Mass Conflicts in Pro-Worker Reforms_, examines the conditions under which autocrats enact labor legislation that protects workers. I argue that the autocrat faces a dilemma in progressive redistributive reforms. While autocrats can preempt heightened mass threats by making policy concessions, such actions often provoke elite resistance. I develop a theory judicial balancing that highlights how limited independent judiciaries provide autocrats with the flexibility to either (1) mitigate elites’ losses resulting from pro-worker legislation or (2) tilt the balance in favor of labor, particularly when social stability concerns loom large. Such judicial flexibility provides autocrats with a stronger incentive to enact pro-worker legislation as a response to bottom-up demand. To illustrate this argument,


Before coming to Atlanta, I lived in Taipei. I received my M.A. and B.A. degree in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I found my intellectual home in autocratic politics and the political economy of redistribution when I visited [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as an exchange student.
