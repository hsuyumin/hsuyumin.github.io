I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/). My main research agenda centers around redistributive politics under dictatorships. The central theoretical perspective that ties together my dissertation project and related work focuses on how institutions impact (re)distribution by structuring elite-mass conflicts and public preferences. In pursuit of these research themes, I improve measurement  in cross-national research and employ quasi-experimental design and survey experiments in single-country cases. 

In my dissertation project, I seek to answer the question of why some autocracies enact labor legislation that protects workers and explore mass political consequences of progressive labor legislation, emphasizing how the authoritarian judiciary helps control the distributive conflicts between elites and masses in the context of labor reforms. Empirical examinations of the argument utilize a wide range of data from multiple sources: an original latent measure of mass threats under nondemocracies; subnational data on local labor regulations and nearly 500,000 labor litigation outcomes in China; and survey experiments of Chinese netizens. Combined, these sources allow me to illustrate the true dynamics of pro-worker legislation, from the conditions and processes leading to its enactment to the mass politics it engenders.

Beyond my dissertation project, my broader research interests encompass the political economy of inequality and redistribution and politics of public goods provision, where I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives (e.g., misperceptions, centralization, and propaganda) to study redistribution (preferences) and public goods provision.  

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at the [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
