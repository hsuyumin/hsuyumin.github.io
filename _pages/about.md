I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/). My main research agenda centers around redistributive politics under dictatorships. In my dissertation project, I try to answer the question of why some autocracies enact labor legislation that protects workers and explore mass political consequences of progressive labor legislation, emphasizing how the authoritarian judiciary helps control the distributive conflicts between elites and masses in the context of labor reforms. My committee members include Jennifer Gandhi (Chair), Jeffrey Staton, Natalia Bueno, and Miguel Rueda.

Beyond the dissertation project, my broader research interests encompass the political economy of inequality and redistribution and politics of public goods provision in democratic and nondemocratic contexts, where I draw on various theoretical perspectives (e.g., internal migration, the interaction between authoritarian institutions and ideology, the tax-welfare mix, and centralization) to study redistribution (preferences) and public goods provision.  

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from National Taiwan University. I was an exchange student at the Tsinghua University in China.
