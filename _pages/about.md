I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study autocratic politics, comparative courts, and the political economy of redistribution, with a regional focus on East Asia. 

My primary research interest lies in redistributive politics under dictatorship. My research advances the research frontier by exploring its intersection with autocratic courts and government propaganda. Specifically, I focus on (1) how dependent courts, through their flexibility to adjudicate cases in accordance with autocrats' situational needs, shape the causes and consequences of autocratic redistribution and (2) why autocrats proactively communicate their redistributive efforts and examine how such propaganda shapes political attitudes. My work has been accepted by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
