I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, institutions, and behavior, with a substantive focus on redistribution, courts, and propaganda in authoritarian regimes. Geographically, my work draws evidence from China, Taiwan, and the United States.

My research revolves around this central question: how do autocrats survive in power when the two fundamental threats (elites and the masses) escalate and collide? With a specific focus on autocratic redistribution, I answer this question from two theoretical angles. First, I put forward a theory elucidating how autocrats can take advantage of compliant courts to resolve the intensified distributional conflict. Second, I argue that autocrats can employ redistributionist propaganda to avoid elite-mass conflict while bolstering regime legitimacy from this symbolic tactic. In a related, secondary agenda, I conducted policy-relevant research on the domestic politics of Taiwan, a case of growing significance with security implications for the rise of China. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
