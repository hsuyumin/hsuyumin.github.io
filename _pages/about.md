I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My main research agenda centers around redistributive politics under dictatorships. The central theoretical perspective that ties together my dissertation project and related work focuses on how institutions impact (re)distribution by structuring elite-mass conflicts and public preferences. My solo-authored research is forthcoming at _Comparative Political Studies_ and _Comparative Politics_.

My dissertation project seeks to answer the question of why some autocracies enact labor legislation that protects workers and explore mass political consequences of progressive labor legislation, emphasizing how the authoritarian judiciary helps control the distributive conflicts between elites and masses in the context of labor reforms. In pursuit of this research theme, I advance measurement approach in cross-national research and employ quasi-experimental design and survey experiments in China.

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at the [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
