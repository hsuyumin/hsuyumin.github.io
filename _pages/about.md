I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, institutions, and behavior, with a substantive focus on redistribution, courts, and propaganda in authoritarian regimes. Geographically, my work concentrates on China, Taiwan, and the United States.

My research revolves around this central question: how do autocrats survive in power when the two fundamental threats (elites and the masses) escalate and collide? With a specific focus on autocratic redistribution, I answer this question from two new theoretical lenses. First, I put forward a theory of judicial balancing to elucidate how autocrats can take advantage of compliant courts to manage the intensified distributional conflict. Second, I theorize that autocrats can strategically employ redistributionist propaganda to avoid elite-mass conflict while bolstering regime legitimacy through information maneuvers. In a related, secondary agenda, I have conducted and developed policy-relevant research projects on the domestic politics of Taiwan, a case of growing significance with profound implications for regional security amid the rise of China. My work has been published by Comparative Politics, Comparative Political Studies, and Political Behavior and invited to revise and resubmit by the Journal of Politics. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
