I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, political institutions, and mass political behavior. Specifically, I study the causes and consequences of redistribution both in autocratic and democratic contexts, with a regional focus on East Asia. My scholarly work has been published by _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, and _Political Behavior_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

My research on autocratic redistribution concerns the strategic logic of progressive redistribution under autocracy and its political consequences for autocratic rule. My primary contributions thus far to this body of research are theoretical and empirical, focusing mainly on China. First, I develop a new theory that elucidates how non-independent courts, through their flexibility to balance elite-mass conflict in labor disputes, provide incentives for autocrats to enact pro-worker legislation. Second, I assess the effects of redistributionist propaganda on political attitudes and theorize why autocrats increasingly employ symbolic tactics in their redistribution strategies.

My work on democratic (re)distribution, on the other hand, addresses (1) why public goods provision varies across subnational electoral democracies and (2) why individuals support redistribution policies that act against their self-interest. For the former, I focus on elite capture in the process of public good production and evaluate the degree to which centralized institutions can improve public service provision by curbing such elite influence. For the latter, my research adds to previous studies that attribute the failure of democracy to reduce inequality to the limited information among ordinary citizens, applying this information-based argument to explain the puzzle of support for regressive taxation.

In pursuit of these research themes, I embrace methodological diversity and use mixed methods to establish causal relationships and ensure the validity of findings. I delve into cases from China, Taiwan, and the U.S. via process tracing, quasi-experimental designs, and survey experiments. In cross-national research, I endeavor to improve the measurement validity and develop a unified and theoretically-informed approach to measuring mass threats (a proxy of redistributive pressure) in non-democracies. 

Before coming to Emory, I received my M.A. and B.A. degrees in political science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China, where I found my intellectual passion in autocratic politics, labor, welfare, and comparative political economy.
