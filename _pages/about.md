I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Emory University](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) and a pre-doctoral fellow with the Democracy Program at the Carter Center. I study autocratic politics, comparative courts, and the political economy of redistribution, with a regional focus on East Asia. My main research agenda contributes to redistributive politics under dictatorship by focusing on (1) how autocratic courts help control elite-mass conflicts amid distributive tensions and (2) how authoritarian citizens react to redistributive efforts and the role of propaganda in this process. My dissertation and related research in democratic contexts draw on evidence from China, Taiwan, and the U.S. and utilize a variety of advanced statistical methods to ensure causality and measurement validity. My work has been published by _Comparative Politics_ and _Comparative Political Studies_ and invited to revise and resubmit by the _Journal of Politics_. 

My dissertation project seeks to answer the question of why some autocracies enact labor legislation that protects workers and explore mass political consequences of progressive labor legislation, emphasizing how the authoritarian judiciary helps control the distributive conflicts between elites and masses in the context of labor reforms. In pursuit of this research theme, I advance measurement approach in cross-national research and employ quasi-experimental design and survey experiments in China.

Before coming to Emory, I earned my MA and BA degree in political science and a minor in anthropology from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I was an exchange student at the [Tsinghua University in China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
