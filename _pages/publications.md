## Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Regulations
* Status: Revise and Resubmit.
* Paper presented at APSA 2021 and MPSA 2021; [APOSS Webinar](https://aposs.cc/schedule/appease-workers-without-losses-autocracy-and-progressive-labor-regulations-by-hsu-yumin-wang/).

`Abstract` 
Under what conditions would dictators enact labor legislation that protects workers? Many schools of thought suggest that heightened mass discontent prompts dictators to make policy concessions to buy off revolutionary threats. However, a more protective labor law may decrease elites' economic benefits and thus loyalty to the incumbent regime. I argue that an ineffective court system can help dictators to balance workers' gains and elites' losses as it allows dictators to more easily control the judicial process of labor disputes to mitigate distributional losses among elites. I test this argument by conducting time-series cross-section analysis covering 68 autocracies from 1970 to 2008. I then offer an illustrative case from the 2008 Labor Contract Law in China to illuminate how features of an ineffective judiciary enable autocrats to control distributional consequences of the law. Through this lens, the paper deepens our understanding of authoritarian survival strategies in the shadow of distributive tensions.

## Centralization, Elite Capture, and Service Provision: Evidence from Taiwan
* Status: Revise and Resubmit.
* Paper presented at APSA 2021 and MPSA 2021.

`Abstract` 
Few theoretical debates in comparative political economy are as controversial as the benefits and costs of decentralization vis-à-vis centralization. This study empirically contributes to the debate by focusing on a rare partial rollout institutional change that reversed local decentralized governance in Taiwan. Utilizing a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that centralization, on average, decreases public goods provision by roughly 40% of a within-unit standard deviation. Contrary to the theoretical prediction that centralization promotes service provision by undermining elite capture, there is no strong evidence for the welfare-enhancing effect of centralization in areas where pre-reform elite capture problems are serious. Additional tests suggest that these results can be attributed in part to (1) the slow realization of the undermining of elite influence and (2) the indirect accountability mechanism, which is challenged in the Taiwanese context, failing to offset centralization's weakness in political accountability.

## Exploring the Microfoundations of the Link between Regressive Taxation and the Welfare State: Experimental Evidence from the United States
* Status: Revise and Resubmit.
* Paper to be presented at MPSA 2022

`Abstract` 
Comparative research shows that the state has increasingly financed social policy through regressive taxation, but the literature has yet to pay close attention to unpacking the microfoundations underlying this pattern. This paper explores the sources of micro-level support for the use of regressive taxation to fund social policy in America, where sales taxes account for nearly one-third of state government revenue and the majority of local citizens at times approve sales tax ballot measures. This paper argues that equal treatment norm and a lack of information about the redistributive consequences of sales taxes may explain the support and employs a survey experiment to test the two explanations. While experimental results provide little evidence for the effect of equal treatment norm, providing information about the redistributive consequences of sales taxes significantly decreases support for the use of sales taxes to finance social policies, and the information treatment effect is moderated by respondents’ income level. These findings contribute to the growing literature on the (micro) politics of regressive taxation as well as how tax structure and economic misperceptions affect support for redistribution.

## Institutions and Democratization in Right-Wing Dictatorships (with [Jennifer Gandhi](https://www.jennifergandhi.com/) and [Dulce Manzano](http://webs.ucm.es/info/socio6ed/main/Fichas%20personal/DulceManzano/DulceManzano.htm))
* Status: Under Review.
* Paper presented at [ECPR 2020](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/55046).

`Abstract` 
How does the ideology and institutional organization of authoritarian regimes affect processes of democratization? Class-based analyses of democratic transitions focus on how the poor mobilize against the rich to press for democratization under right-wing authoritarian regimes (Boix 2003, Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). While these models do much to further our understanding of democratization, they neither empirically verify the uniqueness of their claims for right-wing regimes nor take into account the role of institutions in dictatorships. In this paper, dictatorial institutions are brought to the fore in explaining patterns of regime transitions. Our theory establishes that the effect of these institutions will be conditional on the ideology of the regime. Faced with a high revolutionary threat posed by the poor, right-wing dictatorships endowed with political institutions (political parties and legislature) that enable lower-income sectors to secure redistributive policies are less likely to democratize (and more likely to survive). These institutions serve to maintain redistributive transfers even when the revolutionary threat of the poor diminishes. We provide evidence of these claims using original data on the ideological orientation of all dictatorships during the 1960-2008 period.

## Courting Condemnation: Audience Costs and International Court Compliance using Survey Evidence from China (with [Stefano Jud](http://stefanojud.com/) and Will Giles)
* Status: Under Review.
* Poster presented at MPSA 2022.

`Abstract` 
Are international courts effective in changing state behavior and fostering international cooperation? Conventional wisdom suggests that international courts can promote cooperation since governments suffer domestic audience costs from non-compliance. Despite the possibility of audience costs, there are still many governments refusing to comply with decisions of international courts. We argue that this is because unfavorable rulings can spark domestic backlash among citizens against international courts. As a result, non-compliance should increase domestic support, especially amongst highly-nationalistic individuals. We tested the argument using a conjoint survey experiment in China where we exposed respondents to a hypothetical case where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an unfavorable ruling against China. We find that citizens prefer that the Chinese government does not comply with the ruling and these preferences are significantly stronger among individuals with strong nationalist sentiment. The results of our experiment highlight that, contrary to previous literature, international courts may not always induce international cooperation.

## A Latent Variable Approach to Measuring Mass Threats in Nondemocracies

* Poster presented at [Asian PolMeth 2022](https://asianpolmeth.github.io/AsianPolmeth2022/index.html)

`Abstract` 
Mass threat is a critical factor in explaining regime change and various political outcomes of authoritarian politics. However, the literature to date is divided over how to measure it in cross-national settings. To measure mass threats, numerous prior studies rely on measures related to economic grievances, whereas others emphasize the aspect of organizational capacity of mass mobilization. Additionally, substantial missing data remains a common problem of the existing measures of mass threats. In this paper, I propose a more comprehensive, latent measure of mass threats in non-democracies that seeks to bridge the divide. Utilizing a Bayesian dynamic latent variable approach, the model synthesizes information on manifest indicators from the two facets, generating time-series cross-sectional data of mass threats covering 138 authoritarian countries from 1970 to 2008. I conduct several checks to demonstrate the validity of the new measure and use it to replicate Svolik’s (2013) central results of the inverted U-shaped relationship between mass threats and military intervention.

### Attitudes toward Internal Migrants and Support for Redistribution: Evidence from Shanghai (with [Eddy Yeung](https://eddy-yeung.github.io/))

      Three mechanisms by which anti-migrant attitudes affect redistribution support are known in the current literature: fiscal burden, welfare chauvinism, and labor market competition. Leveraging the unique context of Shanghai—where internal migrants are often unwelcomed by the locals and where the hukou system is particularly exclusionary in China—we explore how well these existing theories explain the relationship between anti-migrant attitudes and redistribution support among local Shanghainese. We designed a survey experiment that randomly exposed Shanghainese respondents to a prime about (1) fiscal pressure from rural migrants, (2) cultural differences between Shanghainese and rural migrants, or (3) labor market competition threat from rural migrants. Another randomized subset of respondents received a frame about the decreasingly exclusionary nature of Shanghai's hukou system. Respondents across all treatment groups reported statistically insignificant differences in their redistribution support, compared to the baseline attitudes in the pure control group.

### Organized Labor as Obstacles to Redistribution: Inequality, Dualization and Redistributive Spending in Developing Countries
* Master's Thesis. English. [`DOI: 10.6342/NTU201801462`](https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh1?DocID=U0001-1107201817083900)

      Why do some countries redistribute more than others? So far, much of extant work has been confined to the developed countries. This study aims to overcome that drawback, situating this puzzle within the developing world. My argument builds on the reality characterizes most of developing countries: the large size of the informal sector. Combining insider-outsider theory and Meltzer and Richard model, I argue that formal sector workers impede expanding redistributive policies as economic inequality worsens. Labor divide stemming from the segmentation between formal sector and informal sector workers suggests that their preferences for redistributive policies may be different. Furthermore, rising inequality polarizes the discrepancies as a result of more redistribution demanded by the median voter who would be, with high probability, the informal sector worker. In turn, labor market insiders may hinder further redistribution as inequality rises because they may suffer from more taxation to finance more redistributive spending. I buttress this argument by time-series cross-section data covering 18 Latin American countries from 1985 to 2002. This article speaks to the emerging literature on the impact of labor market dualization on welfare regimes around the world.

### The Judicial Sources of Programmatic Politics? How Judicial Independence Curbs Clientelism
* Paper presented at MPSA 2017.

      <summary>Show Abstract</summary>

    What accounts for transitions from clientelism to programmatic politics? In line with existing dominant approach focusing on increasing electoral costs of clientelism triggered by transformation of economic structure such as economic development, mass education, urbanization, and neoliberal reform, we consider another source of costs neglected by extant literature: judicial independence. We argue that progress in judicial independence, through empowering three sets of agents—liberal judges and prosecutors, opposition parties, and critical citizens, makes it more likely that clientelistic politicians who appropriate public resources and buy votes illegally will be sanctioned by the independent courts. As such, judicial independence serves as an important momemtum that makes it difficult for the functioning of clientelism and thus pave the way for programmatic politics. Our empirical examination is twofold. First, we conduct cross-national analysis using Democratic Accountability and Linkages Project (DALP). Second, we test our argument using time-series cross-section data from V-Dem with 117 countries from 1971 to 1999. The statistical results lend support to our theoretical expectation: judicial independence hampers clientelism (in cross-sectional analysis) and is positive to programmatic linkages (in TSCS analysis). This article contributes to the emergent literature on varieties of democratic linkages.
