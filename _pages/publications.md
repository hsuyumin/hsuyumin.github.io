## Appeasing Workers without Great Loss: Autocracy and Progressive Labor Regulations

Paper presented at [APSA 2021](https://tinyurl.com/yxkzhqfs) and MPSA 2021; [APOSS Webinar](https://aposs.cc/schedule/appease-workers-without-losses-autocracy-and-progressive-labor-regulations-by-hsu-yumin-wang/).

`Abstract` 
Under what conditions would dictators enact labor legislation that protects workers? Many schools of thought suggest that heightened mass discontent prompts dictators to make policy concessions to buy off revolutionary threats. However, a more protective labor law may decrease elites' economic benefits and thus loyalty to the incumbent regime. I argue that an ineffective court system can help dictators to balance workers' gains and elites' losses as it allows dictators to more easily control the judicial process of labor disputes to mitigate distributional losses among elites. I test this argument by conducting time-series cross-section analysis covering 68 autocracies from 1970 to 2008. I then offer an illustrative case from the 2008 Labor Contract Law in China to illuminate how features of an ineffective judiciary enable autocrats to control distributional consequences of the law. Through this lens, the paper deepens our understanding of authoritarian survival strategies in the shadow of distributive tensions.

## Centralization, Elite Capture, and Service Provision: Evidence from Taiwan

Paper presented at [APSA 2021](https://tinyurl.com/yzb568ue) and MPSA 2021.

`Abstract` 
Few theoretical debates in comparative political economy are as controversial as the benefits and costs of decentralization vis-à-vis centralization. This study empirically contributes to the debate by focusing on a rare partial rollout institutional change that reversed local decentralized governance in Taiwan. Utilizing a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that centralization, on average, decreases public goods provision by roughly 40\% of a within-unit standard deviation. Contrary to the theoretical prediction that centralization promotes service provision by undermining elite capture, there is no strong evidence for the welfare-enhancing effect of centralization in areas are pre-reform elite capture problems are serious. Additional tests suggest that these results can be attributed in part to (1) the slow realization of the undermining of elite influence and (2) the indirect accountability mechanism, which is challenged in the Taiwanese context, failing to offset centralization's weakness in political accountability.

## Institutions and Democratization in Right-Wing Dictatorships (with [Jennifer Gandhi](https://www.jennifergandhi.com/) and [Dulce Manzano](http://webs.ucm.es/info/socio6ed/main/Fichas%20personal/DulceManzano/DulceManzano.htm)) (Under Review)

Paper presented at [ECPR 2020](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/55046).

`Abstract` How does the ideology and institutional organization of authoritarian regimes affect processes of democratization? Class-based analyses of democratic transitions focus on how the poor mobilize against the rich to press for democratization under right-wing authoritarian regimes (Boix 2003, Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). While these models do much to further our understanding of democratization, they neither empirically verify the uniqueness of their claims for right-wing regimes nor take into account the role of institutions in dictatorships. In this paper, dictatorial institutions are brought to the fore in explaining patterns of regime transitions. Our theory establishes that the effect of these institutions will be conditional on the ideology of the regime. Faced with a high revolutionary threat posed by the poor, right-wing dictatorships endowed with political institutions (political parties and legislature) that enable lower-income sectors to secure redistributive policies are less likely to democratize (and more likely to survive). These institutions serve to maintain redistributive transfers even when the revolutionary threat of the poor diminishes. We provide evidence of these claims using original data on the ideological orientation of all dictatorships during the 1960-2008 period.

  Why do some countries redistribute more than others? So far, much of extant work has been confined to the developed countries. This study aims to overcome that drawback, situating this puzzle within the developing world. My argument builds on the reality characterizes most of developing countries: the large size of the informal sector. Combining insider-outsider theory and Meltzer and Richard model, I argue that formal sector workers impede expanding redistributive policies as economic inequality worsens. Labor divide stemming from the segmentation between formal sector and informal sector workers suggests that their preferences for redistributive policies may be different. Furthermore, rising inequality polarizes the discrepancies as a result of more redistribution demanded by the median voter who would be, with high probability, the informal sector worker. In turn, labor market insiders may hinder further redistribution as inequality rises because they may suffer from more taxation to finance more redistributive spending. I buttress this argument by time-series cross-section data covering 18 Latin American countries from 1985 to 2002. This article speaks to the emerging literature on the impact of labor market dualization on welfare regimes around the world.

### The Judicial Sources of Programmatic Politics? How Judicial Independence Curbs Clientelism

Paper presented at MPSA 2017.

  <summary>Show Abstract</summary>

What accounts for transitions from clientelism to programmatic politics? In line with existing dominant approach focusing on increasing electoral costs of clientelism triggered by transformation of economic structure such as economic development, mass education, urbanization, and neoliberal reform, we consider another source of costs neglected by extant literature: judicial independence. We argue that progress in judicial independence, through empowering three sets of agents—liberal judges and prosecutors, opposition parties, and critical citizens, makes it more likely that clientelistic politicians who appropriate public resources and buy votes illegally will be sanctioned by the independent courts. As such, judicial independence serves as an important momemtum that makes it difficult for the functioning of clientelism and thus pave the way for programmatic politics. Our empirical examination is twofold. First, we conduct cross-national analysis using Democratic Accountability and Linkages Project (DALP). Second, we test our argument using time-series cross-section data from V-Dem with 117 countries from 1971 to 1999. The statistical results lend support to our theoretical expectation: judicial independence hampers clientelism (in cross-sectional analysis) and is positive to programmatic linkages (in TSCS analysis). This article contributes to the emergent literature on varieties of democratic linkages.
